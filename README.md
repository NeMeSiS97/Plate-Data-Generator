This code consists of how to generate plate datawith the help of ALPR Cloud API. The cloud API permits only use of 2000 images per month, but I have reconfigured it to be used as many times as we want.
I have worked on the python version(in the python directory) and has created a code: run.py which takes all the images in the images subdirectory, work on it and enter the plate data into the bbox folder in a txt file with the same name as the image name.
Kindly initialize the code by running setup.py on your system.
